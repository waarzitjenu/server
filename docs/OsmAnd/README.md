The OsmAnd app for iOS and Android has a built-in location tracking functionality. This functionality can be enabled and could be used with this location tracker.

Optionally, you can tell OsmAnd to keep the location updates for a while, in case you lost internet connection.

**5) Enabling the widget for easily turning the location tracking on and off**

It is possible to enable an on-screen widget that shows up in the upper right corner, which can be tapped to switch location tracking on and off.
