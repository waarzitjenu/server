# Running the front-end only

The front-end (map interface) is written in Vue 3 and TypeScript. The Docker image provided by NodeJS can be used to run this front-end, but assuming a working installation of npm/yarn, you could also run it locally, without Docker.

- [Run the front-end with Docker](./With-Docker.md)
- [Run the front-end without Docker](./Without-Docker.md)
